<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
  0.0.4
 fixed console error when opening an NPC sheet.
</p>
<p>
  0.0.3
 Fixed double entries when opening a PC sheet.
 Also fixed, GM with multiple sheets open. Added unique class to each actor sheet. Thus points are not added to other opened actor sheets.
</p>


<p>The module intends to add a variation to inspiration.&nbsp; Instead of having inspiration, I added luck points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luck points will be below resources, on the attributes tab, within the actor sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my campaign, the intent for Luck Points is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A player can hoard as many luck points they choose.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A player can use a luck point to increase or decrease a die roll result.&nbsp; For instance, the player rolls a d20 attack and spends 2 luck points.&nbsp; The roll from the d20 is 16 + the luck points equal 18.</li>
<li>A player can choose to use luck points to help another player but at double the cost. For instance, player B rolls 14, Player A spends 4 luck points.&nbsp; Player Bs roll now becomes 16.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A player can choose to use luck points to decrease the GMs roll but at double the cost. For instance, GM rolls 14, Player A spends 6 luck points. GM roll now becomes 11.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GM has permission to the die (d6)</p>
<p>Players click the bell to consume luck point(s). After clicking the bell, an input box will open beneath the buttons.&nbsp; After entering the number of points to consume, hit the enter key on your keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the GM roll and Player consumption will send a chat message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>This has only been tested and used with Tidy5eSheet and the default actor sheet, with DND5e.</p>
